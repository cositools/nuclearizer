# NCT09 Depth Calculation (3rd poly fit) for D0
# Data used in analysis for front: 
# Data used in analysis for back : 
# Nuclear line used in analysis  : Am-241 60 keV
# 
# Definition: CTD  :Timing(+)-Timing(-)
#             Depth:Distance between cathode(-) and interaction
# Format:strip(+),strip(-),parameter[0]~[3],CTD FWHM front,CTD FWHM back 
#        Depth(cm) = parameter[i]*CTD(ns)^i, i=0~3
# 
# Linear curve from average CTD and average FWHM would replace the bad fits value.
# (ex. Pixel is out of boundary, or few counts (<15), or dead strip.) 
# 
# The 3rd-order polynomial fit for D0 is not done yet.
# Use linear curve from linear calibration data: depth_linear_pixel_D00.csv.
