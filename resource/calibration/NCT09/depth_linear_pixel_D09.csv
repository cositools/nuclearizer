# Linear depth calibration data (by pixel) for D09
#
# Format: [Positive Strip #], [Negative Strip #], [CTD Mean Front], [CTD Mean Back], 
#            [CTD FWHM Front], [CTD FWHM Back]
#
# Provides mean timing in a given pixel for events at front and back
# surfaces of the detector.  Back is defined as the face of detectors
# closest to the dewar, and Front is the other face.
#
# Data file used in analysis for front: ctd_fit_D09_0060_081222_front.idlsave
# Data file used in analysis for back:  ctd_fit_D09_0060_081222_back.idlsave
# Nuclear line used in analysis: Am-241 60 keV
#
# Bad fits have been replaced with average values.
