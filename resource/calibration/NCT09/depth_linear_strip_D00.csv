# Linear depth calibration data (by strip) for D00
#
# Format: [+/-], [Strip#], [Timing Mean Front], [Timing Mean Back],
#            [Timing FWHM Front], [Timing FWHM Back]
#
# Provides mean timing in a given strip for events at front and back
# surfaces of the detector.  Back is defined as the face of detectors
# closest to the dewar, and Front is the other face.
#
# Data file used in analysis for front: XXXX
# Data file used in analysis for back:  XXXX
# Nuclear line used in analysis: Am-241 60 keV
#
# Analysis performed by Mark Bandstra on XXXX
# If this file is blank, it means the calibration has not yet been performed.
