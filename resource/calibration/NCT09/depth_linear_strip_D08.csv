# Linear depth calibration data (by strip) for D08
#
# Format: [+/-], [Strip#], [Timing Mean Front], [Timing Mean Back],
#            [Timing FWHM Front], [Timing FWHM Back]
#
# Provides mean timing in a given strip for events at front and back
# surfaces of the detector.  Back is defined as the face of detectors
# closest to the dewar, and Front is the other face.
#
# Data file used in analysis for front: time_hist_ctd_fit_D08_0060_081007_front.idlsave
# Data file used in analysis for back:  time_hist_ctd_fit_D08_0060_081007_back.idlsave
# Nuclear line used in analysis: Am-241 60 keV
