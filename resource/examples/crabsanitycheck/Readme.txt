Crab reference analysis

Remarks:
(1) The script currently looks into the .nuclearizer.cfg file for the geometry. Thus make sure you have the correct geometry in there.
(2) The dat file directory id currently the default data directory in mobius. If you don't have access to it, please download the data locally and modify Day_160612.dat & Day_160613.dat to point to the correct path.
